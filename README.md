# Hello World (Beginner)

Get started with C as quickly as possible.

## What is the `Hello World` project all about?

This repository contains concise code examples with sufficient explanations to help readers begin programming in C. The focus is on idiomatic and standard C practices without complicated or overly opinionated design decisions.

**NOTE: I've purposefully have used `.exe` for target extension files in examples, it makes the `Makefile` and the compile commands can be used on windows and linux the same.**

## Setting Up the Compiler

There are numerous resources available for setting up a C compiler, and if you're here, you likely have one installed. This guide assumes you're familiar with command-line compilation using `gcc` or `clang` on POSIX operating systems. If you prefer using an IDE like CLion or Visual Studio 2022, feel free to consult specific resources for those tools.

### An Alternative

The `Zig` programming language compiler can serve as a convenient, drop-in C compiler.

You can download it from [here](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig). After installation, add it to your system path or use it directly from the command line with `../../zig/zig cc ...`. You get the idea.
